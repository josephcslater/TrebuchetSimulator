%TREBDSGN Simulates the throw of a Trebuchet and estimates%maximum distance an object could be thrown if released at%the right time. The help for TREBDSGN is much more helpful%if accessed from withing TREBDSGN. Type TREBDSGN (in lower %case) and select the red help button.%%TREBDSGN allows you to interactively enter design variables%and obtain performance estimates for the trebuchet shown.%The trebuchet as shown throws the object to the left. The%counter mass is at the left hanging from the rope, and the %projectile is on the ground at the otherend of the device.%Apon release, the counter mass drops, and the projectile %is dragged to the right initially, then it continues in a %counter clockwise fashion about the pivot point. Select %"show movies" and push "go" to simulate the motion and show %a movie of it. The meanings of the variables on the right %hand side of the main window are shown in the figure above %and in descriptions below. Various bits of simulation re-%sults are available by selecting the appropriate check boxes %to the bottom left. All units used must be consistant units. %For SI, use kg-m-s (N) units, and for English units, use %slug-ft-s (lbf) units. All angles are in radians.%%                     VARIABLE DEFINITIONS%  %  l1, l2, l3, and l5 are clear from the diagram.%  l4       is the distance from the pivot point to the center %              of the lever arm.%  m1       is the mass of the counterweight.%  m2       is the mass of the lever arm.%  m3       is the mass of the projectile.%  J        is the mass moment of inertia of the lever arm. %              For a uniform cross section arm, it is equal to%              m2*((l2+l5)^2)/12+l4^2)%  T Final  is the total simulation time. %  Height   is the height of the trebuchet pivot point above %              the ground.%  Phi Init is the initial amount the trebuchet is cocked in %              radians. It is zero when the counter mass is %              directly above the pivot point. 0 is better.%              In plots, it is the angle Phi2.%  Phi1, Phi2, Phi3 are shown in the figure above. They can be%              viewed as a function of simulated time by %              selecting the appropriate checkboxes before%              a simulation run.%             %  To change any of the variables, select the appropriate box%  and edit the variable. The variable will be accepted when%  you hit return (or enter) or when you select another box.%
